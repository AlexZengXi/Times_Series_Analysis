    "The Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) is a Fourier transform spectrometer that was launched by NASA on the Aura spacecraft in July 2004. The instrument measures radiation from the atmosphere in the thermal infrared region of the spectrum. The file `TES_spectra.txt` contains TES measurements on 10 July 2010 from the 2B1 filter on TES. In this spectral region, vertical profiles of atmopsheric temprature and water vapour can be retrieved. (The file contains the spectrum as a function of wavenumbers $\\tilde{\\nu} = 1/\\lambda$ in units of cm$^{-1}$). One way of simulating the spectrum that might be measured by a low-resolution version of TES is by convolving the TES high-resolution spectrum with the function $2\\Delta\\sin(2\\pi \\tilde{\\nu}\\Delta)/(2\\pi \\tilde{\\nu}\\Delta)$, where $\\Delta$ is a measure of the spectral resolution.\n",
